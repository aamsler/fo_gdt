# fo_gdt

## Welcome at the Forum on Government Digital Transformation (fo_gdt).

To simplify the buildup of *fo_gdt* the main language of communication for the time being will be English. *fo_gdt* has been initiated by Andreas Amsler. More info about me you find on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aamsler/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/andreasamsler">Twitter</a> profiles. 

But *fo_gdt* is not about me personally, it starts with three questions: 

1. What is the purpose of government?
2. What is the purpose of government services?
3. What is the purpose of government digital services?

Today it is not yet defined what *fo_gdt* will develop into. First I need to know, if you are willing to discuss these (and related) questions with me and others â€“ in the open. 

Drop your answers on twitter mentioning the question number and using the hashtag #fo_gdt. Here are my current answers:

1. <a href="https://twitter.com/andreasamsler/status/826572190913015808">Q1: Ensure a secure space with equally shared rights and duties for the benefit of a prosperous society and economy #fo_gdt</a>
2. <a href="https://twitter.com/andreasamsler/status/826574705691918336">Q2: Meet demands for information and offer necessary transactions to citizens and NGOs in a non-discriminative way #fo_gdt</a>
3. <a href="https://twitter.com/andreasamsler/status/826575655001325568">Q3: Put real users' needs at the center of your service, define KPIs, measure performance, and iterate your service accordingly #fo_gdt</a>

I have received feedbacks, that people would like to express their views, however not publicly. Feel free to contact me directly using the private channel of your choice - probably <a href="mailto:a.amsler@gmail.com"   target="_blank">e-mail</a>. I will not disclose any source nor publish privately made quotes without prior authorisation by the source.

Still, I would like to find out, if there is demand to publicly discuss about the questions at hand. If not at all or not substantially, I would like to hear your feedbacks about possible reasons? Again feel free to share these with me either <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23fo_gdt&src=typd">in the open</a> or <a href="mailto:a.amsler@gmail.com"   target="_blank">privately</a>.
