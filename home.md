# fo_gdt

## Welcome at the Forum on Government Digital Transformation (fo_gdt).

To simplify the buildup of *fo_gdt* the main language of communication for the time being will be English. *fo_gdt* has been initiated by Andreas Amsler. More info about me you find on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aamsler/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/andreasamsler">Twitter</a> profiles. 

But *fo_gdt* is not about me personally, it starts with three questions: 

1. What is the purpose of government?
2. What is the purpose of government services?
3. What is the purpose of government digital services?

Today it is not yet defined what *fo_gdt* will develop into. First I need to know, if you are willing to discuss these (and related) questions with me and others â€“ in the open. 

Drop your answers on twitter mentioning the question number and using the hashtag #fo_gdt. Here are my current answers:
