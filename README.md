# fo_gdt

## Welcome at the Forum on Government Digital Transformation (fo_gdt).

To simplify the buildup of *fo_gdt* the main language of communication for the time being will be English. *fo_gdt* has been initiated by Andreas Amsler. More info about me you find on my LinkedIn and Twitter profiles. 

But *fo_gdt* is not about me personally, it is about your and my convictions about three questions:

1. What is the purpose of government?
2. What is the purpose of government services?
3. What is the purpose of government digital services?
